## Variables in the output file mean.txt

#Column 1 - SubjectID 
This is the identifying number for the 30 volunteers that undertook the tests. 

#Column 2 - Activity
This is the label of the 6 activities performed by the volunteers

#Column 3 to 88 - "tBodyAcc-mean()-X"....."fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std()"
These are the 86 means and standard deviations of the gyroscope and accelerometer readings that we subset from original testing and training data.

After which these variables are each treated further by taking the average for each activity and each subject.
